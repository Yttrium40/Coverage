Coverage: a program to calculate how many times a locus (position) is included in a read (a range with starting position and length).

Both the loci and reads are given in .csv files loci.csv and reads.csv. loci_solved.csv shows what loci.csv looks like after the program has been run with it and reads.csv.
Make sure to extract reads.csv from the archive before running the program!
